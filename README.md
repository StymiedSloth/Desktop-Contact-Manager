# Desktop-Contact-Manager
A User Interface showcase project built using Java FXML

This was a course project, we were asked to create an intuitive desktop contacts manager. 
Special stress was placed on UI rather than coding and were encouraged to be more accommodating to taditional users.

THe result is this app which had easy to learn shortcuts, left to right reading pattern, bold colors, traditional elements 
fused with newer ones etc. 

The home screen of the app

The edit screen. this can be reached by either selecting a contact and clicking edit or just navigating to the contact using arrow keys and pressing the key 'e' to edit it

Just some mandatory validation, nothing too special

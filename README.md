# Desktop-Contact-Manager
A User Interface showcase project built using Java FXML

This was a course project, we were asked to create an intuitive desktop contacts manager. 
Special stress was placed on UI rather than coding and were encouraged to be more accommodating to taditional users.

THe result is this app which had easy to learn shortcuts, left to right reading pattern, bold colors, traditional elements 
fused with newer ones etc.
